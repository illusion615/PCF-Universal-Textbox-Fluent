## Deployment Notice

When deploying the PCF control, you might encounter an error stating that the webresource content size is too big. To avoid this error, ensure that your environment settings allow for a larger attachment size. In your Power Apps / Dynamics 365 administration:

1. **Adjust the Attachment Size Limit:**
   - Navigate to the environment settings.
   - Locate the **Attachments maximum file size** under **Email settings**.
   - Increase the limit to accommodate your optimized bundle size (for this release I set the attachment size to 102400kb).

2. **Optimize Your Bundle:**
   - Use production mode, minification, and code splitting as configured in the projectâ€™s webpack configuration.
   - Remove unused dependencies to reduce the overall bundle size.
